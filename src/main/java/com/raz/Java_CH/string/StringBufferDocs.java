       /* StringBuffer in Java is a mutable sequence of characters, meaning it can be modified after it is created.
        It is part of the java.lang package and is used when you need to perform a lot of modifications to strings (e.g., concatenation, insertion, deletion).
        Unlike String, which is immutable, StringBuffer allows changes without creating new objects, making it more efficient for certain operations.*/


       /* Mutable: Can be modified after creation.
          Thread-Safe: All its methods are synchronized, making it safe for use in multi-threaded environments.
          Efficient for Modifications: Better performance than String for frequent modifications.*/

        /*
        StringBuffer(): Creates an empty StringBuffer with an initial capacity of 16 characters.
        StringBuffer(int capacity): Creates an empty StringBuffer with the specified capacity.
        StringBuffer(String str): Creates a StringBuffer with the specified string.*/
